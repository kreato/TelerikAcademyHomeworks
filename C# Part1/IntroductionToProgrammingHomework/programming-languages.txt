Problem 11. Programming Languages
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.


-----C-----
C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.


-----C++-----
C++ is a general-purpose programming language, that has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is designed with a bias toward system programming and has also been found useful in many other contexts, including desktop applications, servers, performance-critical applications, and entertainment software. C# and Java have been influenced by C++.


-----Java-----
Java is a functional computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.


-----C#-----
C# is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. There are many languages, that have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, and C# is one of them.


-----Python-----
Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.


-----Ruby-----

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Ruby was influenced by other languages such as Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design.
