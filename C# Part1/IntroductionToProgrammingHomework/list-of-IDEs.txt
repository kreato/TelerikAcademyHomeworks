Problem 12. Development Environments
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
Write in a text file called “list-of-IDEs.txt” at least five IDEs along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.


-----Visual Studio-----
Microsoft Visual Studio offers a multitude of editions for developing, testing, and deploying applications for the web, desktop, mobile, and even game consoles. With a plethora of testing and compatibility tools, you can test on virtual machines, tap into the functionality of BrowserStack to see what your app looks like across more than 300 browsers, run compatibility reports to identify patterns and issues between browsers and so much more.


-----CodeLite-----
An Open-Source, cross-platform IDE for C and C++ coding languages, CodeLite works on all major platforms. CodeLite offers a variety of features, including two built-in completion engines, compilers, refactoring, code navigation and more.


-----AppBuilder-----
Telerik’s AppBuilder provides a single framework for developing apps compatible with iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8 platforms. AppBuilder relies on the web-standard technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and you can build in your choice of five IDEs — all integrated with AppBuilder, or build within your web browser using all the features you’d expect from a desktop IDE.


-----Komodo-----
Komodo is a comprehensive IDE that supports all major programming languages, providing a single tool that meets your development needs across the spectrum. Whether you’re working with Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, HTML, CSS or JavaScript, Komodo provides a clean, intuitive interface with advanced editing capabilities and integrated tools for the most functionality. 


-----Aptana Studio 3-----
Aptana Studio 3 is one of the most powerful open-source IDEs. It provides a faster and seamless environment for developing and testing an entire web application using a single environment. Aptana Studio 3 supports all the major browser technology specs, eliminating compatibility and testing challenges to speed your time to deployment.


-----MonoDevelop-----
MonoDevelop is a GNOME IDE designed primarily for C# and other .NET languages, but it’s open to most any language and has some variation in supported languages across platforms. MonoDevelop enables the rapid development of  desktop and ASP.NET web applications for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms, with the option to port applications created with Visual Studio to Mac and Linux platforms, allowing for a consistent code base across platforms.
